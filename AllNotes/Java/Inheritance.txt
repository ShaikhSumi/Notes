1)Constructors, SIB – Static Initialization Block and IIB – Instance Initialization Block of super class
 will not be inheriting to its sub class.
 But they are executed while creating an object to sub class.
 
 2)class A
{
    int i;
 
    A(int i)
    {
        System.out.println("Class A Constructor");
    }
}
 
class B extends A
{
    int j;
}

You will get a compile time error saying implicit default constructor 
A() is undefined for Class A. 
Compiler will force you to write constructor in Class B. 
Because, we are not defining constructor for Class B. 
So, compiler will be providing default constructor.
In that default constructor, first statement is super() – 
it is a calling statement to default constructor of Class A. 
But it is not defined in Class A. 
Therefore you will get a compile time error. 
To avoid this error, write the constructor for sub class. 
From that constructor call super class constructor explicitly.
